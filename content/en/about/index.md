I've been a software engineer in the industry for six years, both in the Midwest and on the West Coast. 

I enjoy solving problems that come up durign the engineering process, and I started this blog to document some of the more interesting problem that I have solved.

Please refer to the quote and video below for more information, or contact me on GitHub or by email if you have any questions.

"Hey look, buddy. I'm an engineer, that means I solve problems. Not problems like \"What is beauty?\", 'cause that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems!"
